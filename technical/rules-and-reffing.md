        Each game will have two referees (Refs). The Refs will be two players
        from other teams in the league. The Refs are present to oversee the
        game, ensure rules are being followed and that the game is being played
        in a fair, sporting and rapid fashion. The Ref has full authority to
        enforce all rules, including calling players out at his/her discretion.



        When disputes arise, the ref will make the deciding call. The Ref may stop game play to settle disputes.

        It is important to remember that it remains the player’s responsibility to remove him/herself from the court when hit or caught out, and to follow all the rules.



        If a player is exhibiting unsportsmanlike behaviour (e.g., being rude to players or the Ref, disregarding the rules of the game), the Ref will inform the league administrator which may result in expulsion from a game, match or the league.



        The league administrator reserve the right to change or adjust any rule without prior notice, at any point during the league, if necessary.

        Each game begins with 6 players per team on the court, with a minimum of
        two male and two female players per team. Our leagues are co-ed.


        Games will consist of two 25 minute half’s, for a total time of 50 minutes. The game clock does not stop between half’s. The game clock should only stop during time-outs (see section 9) or if the ref deems necessary to handle a special situation.


        * At the end of each half, teams will switch sides of the court.

        * If there is less than 30 seconds left in that half, a new game will not start (switch sides or game ends).

        * If players are left on the court when time ends at either half, it will result in “no blocking” (see section 7).


        6 dodgeballs are used for each game.


        All 6 dodgeballs will start on the center line. Teams will run for the 3 dodgeballs placed on the right hand side of their side of the court. Balls must pass the blue clearing line before the ball is considered live.


        * Balls thrown before they cross the clearing line are considered “dead balls”

        * Teams must only run for the balls on the right side of their court. They cannot interfere with the other team’s balls.

        * If your team clears all 3 balls, you then can take the balls on the left side. But all 3 balls on the right **MUST** be cleared before this is allowed.


        Games begin with all players touching the back wall of their side of the gym. Refs will signal both teams as “ready” and then blow the whistle to initiate the rush.


        Once play has begun, teams must remain on their half of the court.


        * Players may reach across the centre-line to retrieve a ball, but may not touch any surface on the opposing team’s side of the court (i.e. ground, wall or gym apparatus). If a player touches any surface on the opposing team’s side of the court that player is immediately out.

        * A player may not use or make use of an object or aid (such as a ball, scoreboard or dead player) placed on their opponent’s side of the middle line to retrieve a ball.


        Once a player has been hit or caught out they should immediately raise their hand and move to the side of the court, out of play.


        **\*NEW\*** Players who are not playing or have been eliminated may stop balls that roll out of bounds. Balls must immediately be tapped, rolled or directed onto the court.


        * Non-active players may not hold onto balls or keep balls in the out of bounds area of the court. Balls must immediately be directed onto the court.

        * Non-active players may not interfere with balls on the court

        * Any violation of these guidelines will result in the ball being rolled to the opposing team.


        Players may pass balls to team-mates as long as they are “live” players on the court.


        Players may not kick balls at the opposing team.


        To win a game one team must eliminate all the players on the opposing team.


        Game wins and losses are tracked by the Refs. The team with the most wins at the end, wins the match. There is a maximum plus/minus score of +11 in one game.

        A live-ball can eliminate a player, either by making a hit or by being
        caught. A dead-ball cannot eliminate a player.


        A ball is considered live when it is thrown by an opposing player. A ball continues to be live after it hits a player, a ball in the possession of a player, or a live ball.


        A live ball becomes dead when it strikes any object on the court **other than** an active player, a ball in the possession of a player, or a live-ball. (i.e. a ball is dead when it hits the wall, ceiling, basketball hoops, any other apparatus in the gym, a dead-ball or inactive players/spectators)


        If a ball is thrown by a player who has stepped over the centre-line, that ball is immediately considered a dead-ball and cannot eliminate a player on the opposing team.


        Players may hold multiple balls at once. (Beware that a ball knocked out of your possession by a live-ball counts as a hit)


        Players in the possession of a ball may use that ball to block. Live balls that hit only the ball in possession will not eliminate that player, and the ball continues to be live.


        * Please keep in mind that if the live-ball strikes a player’s fingers, the player is out

        * Also, if a player blocks a live-ball into him/herself, that player is out

        A player is out if they have been hit with a live-ball.


        A live-ball can eliminate multiple players (i.e. if a ball ricochets off of a player into another team-mate, both players are out).


        If a player uses a ball in their possession to deflect a live-ball into a team-mate, the team-mate has been hit out.


        A player’s clothing is considered part of that player. If their clothing is hit then the player is out.

        If a player catches a ball thrown by an opposing player, the thrower is

        If a live-ball hits a player, then a team-mate catches it, the player is considered saved (not out) and the catch is valid (thrower out, player returns). The ball must be live for the catch to be valid, (see section 2, live-ball/dead-ball).

        player out, second player in. Hint: line up in order on the sidelines

        To re-enter the game, a returning player must either re-enter the court from the back-line and have both feet touch the court floor (open court) or touch the back wall (closed court) before they are considered active.

        Dodgeball is meant to be a **fast-paced sport**. The following rules are
        meant to keep the pace of the game moving.


        At least one ball must be thrown by the team who has the “advantage” within 10 seconds of gaining advantage. Once at least one ball has been thrown, the count resets. The advantage may still belong to the throwing team, if that team still meets the criteria for having advantage.


        * 1st Advantage – whichever team has more balls on their side of the court

        * 2nd Advantage – whichever team has more players on the court

        * 3rd Advantage – whichever team is playing on the home side of the court (league administrators or Refs will indicate which side is home side)


        Players cannot hide in weird corners or behind apparatus in the gym.


        When the game comes down to a 1v1, the ref will quickly stop the game and call no blocking. Players are to start at the back wall and each side will get 3 balls (regardless of previous possession).


        At half time and at the end of the game (25 minute mark and 50 minute mark), refs will call no blocking by stopping the game. The live players on the court will go to the wall and each side will get 3 balls (regardless of previous possession).

            </div>
        </div>


        During no-blocking play, any ball in the possession of a player is considered part of that player.


        If a player blocks a live ball into the ground with a held ball, the player is out. If a player blocks a live ball into the air and they or a teammate catches it, the catch is good and that player is not out.

                <p>Overtime and settling ties: If a match is tied and there are 30 seconds or less on the clock, a final point will be played with no-blocking rules. Teams will start the match with three balls in their possession (no opening rush).</p>

        * Time-outs stop the game clock and cannot be used to run the game clock in any circumstance.

        Balls must be returned to the court as quickly as is reasonably possible. Retrievers may pass balls to active players or place balls on the court. Retrievers may not hold onto balls on the sidelines.


        Balls must be returned to the same side of the court they were picked up on.


        Retrievers may not interfere with game play in any way. Retrievers may not touch or interfere with any balls inside the court. Reaching in bounds will result in the ball being awarded to the opposing team.

                    <li>A player may not linger out of bounds. They must make every attempt to retrieve the ball(s) and return in-bounds as quickly as possible.</li>
                    <li>The player may be eliminated at any time while they are out of bounds (i.e. they can be hit out).</li>
                    <li>Nothing a player does while out of bounds can eliminate an opponent. If they make a catch, it’s a dead ball, no one is eliminated. They may not throw a ball at their opponents – if a player attempts this they are out.</li>
                    <li>A player may make every attempt to protect themselves. They may block while holding a ball, dodge, etc.</li>

        If a player out of bounds is hit, that ball cannot be caught by or eliminate any player in bounds (e.g. a player hit out of bounds may not be saved by a player in-bounds).
