        \"advantage\"</b>. The team with \"advantage\" will have 10 seconds to
        throw a ball. Once the ball is thrown, the \"count\" resets. (see <a
        href=\"#a3_7\">section 7</a>, flow of the game)\r

        \               <li>1st Advantage is whichever team has more
        balls on their side of the court</li>\r

        players on the court</li>\r

        applies to catching when holding a ball; the catch is valid and the
        thrower is still out.</li>\r

        \         <li>To re-enter the game after a catch has been made,
        the returning player must re-enter the court from the back-line (see <a
        href=\"#a3_6\">section 6</a>, returning a player to the game)</li>\r

        \         <li><b>Head shots: a thrower will not be considered
        out for a hitting a player in the head</b>. Throwers must do their best
        to keep the balls low. (see <a href=\"#a3_4\">section 4</a>, head
        shots).</li>\r

      text: >-
        Each game will have two referees (Refs). The Refs will be two players
        from other teams in the league. The Refs are present to oversee the
        game, ensure rules are being followed and that the game is being played
        in a fair, sporting and rapid fashion. The Ref has full authority to
        enforce all rules, including calling players out at his/her discretion.



        When disputes arise, the ref will make the deciding call. The Ref may stop game play to settle disputes.

        It is important to remember that it remains the playerâ€™s responsibility to remove him/herself from the court when hit or caught out, and to follow all the rules.



        If a player is exhibiting unsportsmanlike behaviour (e.g., being rude to players or the Ref, disregarding the rules of the game), the Ref will inform the league administrator which may result in expulsion from a game, match or the league.



        The league administrator reserve the right to change or adjust any rule without prior notice, at any point during the league, if necessary.
