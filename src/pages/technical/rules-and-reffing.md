                <b>New to Dodgeball Ottawa?</b><br>Here are some rules that you may not be used to:
            </div>
            <div class="notice-card-body">
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>A ball must be thrown by the team who has the "advantage"</b>. The team with "advantage" will have 10 seconds to throw a ball. Once the ball is thrown, the "count" resets. (see <a href="#a3_7">section 7</a>, flow of the game)
                        <ol>
                            <li>1st Advantage is whichever team has more balls on their side of the court</li>
                            <li>2nd Advantage is whichever team has more players on the court</li>
                            <li>3rd Advantage is whichever team is considered on the "home side"</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>You can hold multiple balls at once</b>. This applies to catching when holding a ball; the catch is valid and the thrower is still out.</li>
                    <li>To re-enter the game after a catch has been made, the returning player must re-enter the court from the back-line (see <a href="#a3_6">section 6</a>, returning a player to the game)</li>
                    <li><b>Head shots: a thrower will not be considered out for a hitting a player in the head</b>. Throwers must do their best to keep the balls low. (see <a href="#a3_4">section 4</a>, head shots).</li>
                    <li>We have court boundaries, you may not step off the court (cross the sidelines, back line or centre-line).</li>
                    <li>There are certain scenarios where we play no-blocking (1v1, time limits). See <a href="#a3_7">section 7 </a>for details.</li>
                </ol>
