        Each game will have two referees (Refs). The Refs will be two players
        from other teams in the league. The Refs are present to oversee the
        game, ensure rules are being followed and that the game is being played
        in a fair, sporting and rapid fashion. The Ref has full authority to
        enforce all rules, including calling players out at his/her discretion.
        When disputes arise, the ref will make the deciding call. The Ref may
        stop game play to settle disputes.


        It is important to remember that it remains the player’s responsibility to remove him/herself from the court when hit or caught out, and to follow all the rules.


        If a player is exhibiting unsportsmanlike behaviour (e.g., being rude to players or the Ref, disregarding the rules of the game), the Ref will inform the league administrator which may result in expulsion from a game, match or the league.


        The league administrator reserve the right to change or adjust any rule without prior notice, at any point during the league, if necessary.

        <h3 id="a3_1">Overview and players</h3>


        Each game begins with 6 players per team on the court, with a minimum of two male and two female players per team. Our leagues are co-ed.


        Games will consist of two 25 minute half’s, for a total time of 50 minutes. The game clock does not stop between half’s. The game clock should only stop during time-outs (see section 9) or if the ref deems necessary to handle a special situation.


        * At the end of each half, teams will switch sides of the court.

        * If there is less than 30 seconds left in that half, a new game will not start (switch sides or game ends).

        * If players are left on the court when time ends at either half, it will result in “no blocking” (see section 7).


        6 dodgeballs are used for each game.


        All 6 dodgeballs will start on the center line. Teams will run for the 3 dodgeballs placed on the right hand side of their side of the court. Balls must pass the blue clearing line before the ball is considered live.


        * Balls thrown before they cross the clearing line are considered “dead balls”

        * Teams must only run for the balls on the right side of their court. They cannot interfere with the other team’s balls.

        * If your team clears all 3 balls, you then can take the balls on the left side. But all 3 balls on the right **MUST** be cleared before this is allowed.


        Games begin with all players touching the back wall of their side of the gym. Refs will signal both teams as “ready” and then blow the whistle to initiate the rush.


        Once play has begun, teams must remain on their half of the court.


        * Players may reach across the centre-line to retrieve a ball, but may not touch any surface on the opposing team’s side of the court (i.e. ground, wall or gym apparatus). If a player touches any surface on the opposing team’s side of the court that player is immediately out.

        * A player may not use or make use of an object or aid (such as a ball, scoreboard or dead player) placed on their opponent’s side of the middle line to retrieve a ball.


        Once a player has been hit or caught out they should immediately raise their hand and move to the side of the court, out of play.


        **\*NEW\*** Players who are not playing or have been eliminated may stop balls that roll out of bounds. Balls must immediately be tapped, rolled or directed onto the court.


        * Non-active players may not hold onto balls or keep balls in the out of bounds area of the court. Balls must immediately be directed onto the court.

        * Non-active players may not interfere with balls on the court

        * Any violation of these guidelines will result in the ball being rolled to the opposing team.


        Players may pass balls to team-mates as long as they are “live” players on the court.


        Players may not kick balls at the opposing team.


        To win a game one team must eliminate all the players on the opposing team.


        Game wins and losses are tracked by the Refs. The team with the most wins at the end, wins the match. There is a maximum plus/minus score of +11 in one game.
